Simpler Games is proud to announce the launch of its first mobile title: BreakIt!—a pure stress-busting experience that brings satisfying destruction right to your fingertips. In a world overflowing with rules and restraint, BreakIt! offers the ultimate digital catharsis: break bottles, plates, TVs, and more, all with just a swipe or tap.
Built with Simpler Games’ signature accessible design philosophy, BreakIt! keeps the gameplay minimal while maximizing fun. Whether you've got 30 seconds or 30 minutes, the game delivers immediate gratification with crisp visuals, realistic smash effects, and a leaderboard for the truly relentless destroyers.
“Breaking things shouldn't get you in trouble,” says the Simpler Games team. “It should be fun, fast, and virtual.”
BreakIt! is now available on the Google Play Store, with iOS soon to follow. Players can expect regular content drops—including themed smash packs and seasonal objects to pulverize.
